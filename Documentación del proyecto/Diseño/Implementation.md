# Implementation
In this last increment, the development team proposed to refine the high-fidelity prototype of our social network, this prototype was improved considering the comments made by users surveid in the last installment and their interaction with the social network. This prototype was created in a framework for a generic web browser measuring one thousand four hundred forty by one thousand twenty-four pixels, including all the requirements and always using as a reference the 2 previously created wireframes, where we continue to use the position of basic aspects of chat, news and advice, in addition to the numerous and main changes made to make the experience when using our hi-fi prototype as user-friendly, clear and functional. Where once the testing phase, approval of the users and the approval of the team leaders passed, we could start with the user acceptance stage and add it to the repository as evidence of the project.

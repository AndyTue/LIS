# Design
Once we were finished with the first delivery, we started the process of designing the platform, which we finally defined as a social network with messenger, news section and consultancies as pillars of this platform. First, we created the logo -[See logo](https://github.com/AndyTue/LIS/blob/main/Imag%C3%A9nes/Imag%C3%A9nes/LOGO%20SIANI_preview_rev_1.png "Click Here")and the wireframe (model) on the Balsamiq app -[See wireframe](https://github.com/AndyTue/LIS/blob/main/Imag%C3%A9nes/Imag%C3%A9nes/Wirefrme%20balsamiq.jpg "Click Here").
Once the wireframe was finished, the development of the functional model and the user interface was started, using the Figma app. -[See design](https://www.figma.com/proto/qZKICh2Cj4tN9iSKIJLsRp/SIANI?node-id=90%3A53&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=90%3A53 "Click Here").

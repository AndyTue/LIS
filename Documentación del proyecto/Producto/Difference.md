# What makes us different?

In the surveys carried out with the students of the Bachelor's Degree on Software Engineering we noticed a problem in the lack of information and communication that they have since they enter the university and throughout their entire career, that is why we have decided to create this social network, specialized in people from the Faculty of Mathematics, although in this first stage it will only be available for students and professors of the Faculty of Mathematics at UADY.

# Why use our social network?

Almost all of the student community uses Facebook and WhatsApp to communicate, and these apps are very good, but they also make a diversion to them since, due to lacking an specialization, they end up finding distracting themes or false information, which is why our social networl is centered on the student community of the Faculty of Mathematics, where they will be able to find everything from informative articles, media news and even an efficient communication section between students and even teachers, besides the section of consultancie, where in addition to the advisory section where students can request special class sessions so that they can improve thier academic performance.

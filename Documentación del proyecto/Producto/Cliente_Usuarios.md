As first year student or person interested on entering the Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering career, I want a place where I can find valuable information about the career (whether it is support materials, official documents, videos, etc.), a place where I can communicate with some teachers/professors from the institution so I can obtain guidance through the process (scheduled), look at the Faculty sketch as well as the prominent locations, observe the different experiences of other students and graduates, and to be able to create a profile in order to interact with other users of the web site, all this in order to be prepared for the challenges of the career.

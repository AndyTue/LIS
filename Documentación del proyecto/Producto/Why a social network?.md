## Why social network?
### Justification
Some of the services the SIANI project offers are the following:
> - Messenger service
> - Posts 
> - Profile making.
> - Statuses

Resembles or replicates a social network's functionality, but why did we choose to implement these services? As we know, the problem is the lack of communication and we are aware the communication is an essential requirement in our project, which is why we decided to make a survey to some students of the UADY asking about how effective are UADY's pages  (es.uadyvirtual, ems.uadyvirtual, enlinea2, etc.) many of those surveyed consider that communication is not that good or that bad and applications such as moodle are not 100% specialized in establishing adequate communication within the university community. To support the information mentioned above, the following graphics are presented:

Many of these wish to improve the communication between partners, professors and other agents of the institution, which is why we have opted to make a social network out of SIANI, since that is the objective of the social networks "to improve and agilize the communication among the diverse people of a community".

On the previously shown graphs we can observe that, for first year students, their first impressions are not what they expected, which, in turn, causes many of them to drop out, decrease their academic performance, quit studying altogether, among others. There are many negative consequences caused by this problem, and it's all due to not neing well informed about the career.The stress of the first days of school severely affects students, and drives them to make bad decisions.

## Product: 

Thus, as a result of this, the idea of developing the “Sistema de Introducción para Alumnos de Nuevo Ingreso” (SIANI) project was born.

# SIANI prototype test 
### Process
5 students from the Auntonoma University of Yucatán were contacted, 4 of them are students of the Bachelor of Software Engineering and the other person is a student of another career (this with the aim of seeing the behavior of the prototype to a person external to the careers of the Faculty of Mathematics), it should be noted that they are all first-semester students.

#### Participants 
> - Adjany Armenta Aguilar - Bachelor of Software Engineering
> - Adrián Fonseca Loría - Bachelor of Software Engineering
> - Eyli Burguete Pech - Bachelor of Software Engineering
> - Andrea Margarita Mendoza Tec - Bachelor of Software Engineering
> - Cristi Ruby Flores Mena - Industrial chemical engineering.

### Steps
The prototype application method is explained below:
> 1. As a first step, a presentation was presented to the evaluation group with the purpose of giving a brief introduction to the project (problems, objectives, solution and goals).
> 2. As a next step, a file is shared with them via WhatsApp where the link to the prototype was found and they also specified a series of tasks that they had to do within the prototype.
> 3. Once the prototype test was completed, a validated User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) was performed. Link to page https://www.ueq-online.org
> 4. Some of the evaluators shared their experience and suggestions.
> 5. As a final step, they were thanked for their participation.

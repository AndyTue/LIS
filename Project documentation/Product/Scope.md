# Brief description of the product
Most of the official pages of the institutions seek to provide information in a general way. However, it fails to attend to specific questions of each individual. What our product intends to do is to create a social network where people have the chance to be heard and solve their doubts efficiently and quickly. 
In the same way, we want the students to be able to access various publications, books, documents, texts and images provided by other users, this in order to carry out a more fluid way of communication.

# 1. Test results
The results of the SIANI project "Induction system for new students" will be presented below.

Once the prototype of the project created in Figma was finished, we got in touch with some students from the Faculty of Mathematics (possible users), to evaluate the design and implementation of the SIANI social network.

### 2. Procedure
> - They were given an induction to the project (problems, objectives and functions).
> - The prototype was shared with them.
> - After the testers navigated the platform, they were asked a series of questions.
> - Graphics were made to know the experience of the users.

### 3. Conclusions and graphics
#### 3.1. Interface
As a first point we will talk about the product interface of the social network "SIANI"

The vast majority of the evaluating group considers that the interface is easy to understand, pleasing to the human eye and in addition to having a suitable experience, however, as can be seen in graphs 1 and 2, 2 out of 17 people consider that the form Organizing the elements causes visual stress and they would like a better organization, as well as a cleaner interface, so some of the recommendations left by the group of people will be presented:

Recommendations:

Of these recommendations, the following stand out:
> - Better use in the color gamut.
> - Manimalist design.
> - Dark mode.
> - Simple interface.

#### 3.2. Interaction
As the next point we will talk about the interaction and execution of the program.

The software program works adequately and without mishap, making the users have a good experience (As seen in the graph 3).

#### 3.3. General

Most repeated points: 
> - The social network complies with all the services it offers.
> - Meets users standards.
> - It it complete.
> - It is simple.
> - It is functional. 

Things that could improve:
> - Include other services.
> - Cleaner interface.

#### 3.4. Conclusions
In this section we will talk about the social network in general, including objective, problems, design, interface, requirements, interaction and everything contained in the SIANI project

#### How can we improve your experience?

From the previous question, in order to improve the user experience we will improve the software interface. The highlights are the same as point 3.1.

The services requested by users are the following: 

> - Videocalls
> - Dark mode
> - Introductory Videos
> - Frequently Asked Questions
> - Memes section

About the impact of the project on society they consider the following:

They consider the impact of the SIANI project is positive and they highlight:

In summary:
> - Huge support for first year students, people from the Faculty of Mathematics and students who want to enter the carrer.
> - It would help with communication between students and school staff of the institution.
> - It would improve the interaction between the UADY student community.

However, in the graph we can see that one of the users considers the idea moderately necessary and this is because he feels that there are already several UADY pages that contain some SIANI functions.

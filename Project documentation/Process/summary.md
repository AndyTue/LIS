# Significant changes in the Second Delivery
A summary of the changes made with respect to the first delivery will be presented below, as well as the documentation and the project process have been modified to have better results.
> - From website to social network: the work team decided to make this change, because it turns out to be a more feasible tool for students (It is detailed more clearly in [Why a social network?](https://github.com/AndyTue/LIS/blob/3a861bef5fcaacbaf7aabbe70a6409bf5d2853bd/Project%20documentation/Product/Why%20a%20social%20network%3F.md "Click aquí"))
> - An advisory section is attached: this new requirement arises from a survey carried out with the degree students.
> - The methodology: as a result of an improvement in the organization of the team, improvements were made in the methodology section ([Methodology](https://github.com/AndyTue/LIS/blob/3a861bef5fcaacbaf7aabbe70a6409bf5d2853bd/Project%20documentation/Methodology/Methodology.md "Click aquí"))
> - Design: based on the requirements requested by the team that works together with the Figma work tool, a series of prototypes of the social network were made.
> - Logo: the SIANI company logo was created.
> - Limitations: it was determined that the social network is specialized for students of the Software Engineering career and the other careers of the Faculty of Mathematics, it is expected to expand more (to all students of the Autonomous University of Yucatán).
> - Compatibility: it is only aimed at electronic devices (cell phones, tablets and computers) that have iOS and Android software.
> - Requirements: refined ([Scopes](https://github.com/AndyTue/LIS/blob/3a861bef5fcaacbaf7aabbe70a6409bf5d2853bd/Project%20documentation/Product/Scope.md "Click aquí"))

# Prioritization method: Eisenhower Matrix
- Our main objective for this project is to make obtaining information easy and agile about any questions that students have, either towards school, or towards their career. Likewise, all information that we provide to our users is official of the Autonomous University of Yucatán.
- To make the project effective, we have chosen to develop an ‘Eisenhower priority matrix’, in which we compare and rank the requirements from the least important to the most important.

The previous method, as it was said at the beginning, is known as the "Eisenhower Priority Matrix." In the box in the lower left corner, we can see that it is the least urgent, as the least important. In this we put:
- A friendly graphical interface.
- Include help documentation.

The graphical interface, as well, helps us a lot so that our users get a better experience when using our website, however, it is not the main thing to carry out the project, but not leaving aside, in order to improve it with time. Similarly, the same thing happens with including help documentation.
In the box in the upper left corner, you will find what is important but not so urgent. In that box we find:
- Responsive web design.
- Its design makes it easy to use.
- Section for complaints and suggestions.

Adaptive web design is important, however it is not so urgent since it serves so that both mobile devices and PCs can see the page in a pleasant way on their devices.
The other point is that its design facilitates its use, this serves so that the user does not find it difficult to use the page. Finally, there is the section for complaints and suggestions, in the same way it is important to have it, since this way we can improve our website over time, however, it is not so urgent.
In the lower right corner, we find what is urgent, however, it is not of such importance, in this we find:

- Various links to take users to direct sections.

This point helps us so that users get a better experience, since, by putting the link, it will take them directly to the section of the page where they want to be.
Finally, we find the box where the most important things are found and that are also urgent. In that box we find:

- The web page must work correctly.
- Have official information from the University.
- Do not disclose any type of information about our users.
- That the user has a good experience when using the page.

In the first point, it is of the utmost importance, since this helps the page not to have errors, or to get stuck, that it is an agile page to use, thus making our users use and suggest our page.

In the second point, in the same way, it is in the most important section, since it would fulfill one of our objectives, which is to inform students with official information from the university.

In the next point, in the same way we put it among the most important, since all people like that their information is not shared and that it is safe when registering on any platform, this will help us make our users feel safe when using our page, knowing that, if you enter any type of information, it will not be shared.

Finally, we have the requirement that the user have a good experience after using our page, this will be achieved by carrying out the previous requirements, in order to ensure that our user is satisfied with our page.
